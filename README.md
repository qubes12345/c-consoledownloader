# c-consoledownloader
This program is made in C# and has the ability to download files from the internet just like wget. I am in no way trying to compete with wget but rather see what I could make whilst being bored. Please do not steal credit from me as that would be very unfortunate. You can read the source code to assure yourself that there is nothing malicious within this C# project. Thank-you, and enjoy. Also, some of the code is cluttered and wrong, if there are complaints I may fix these.


Here is the small tutorial:

Usage is as follows. 
Variables: #currentdir# can be used to get the current directory of where the program is running. For example, google.com/img.img #currentdir# yes.png.
With normal usage, 2 parameters are required. The first one (arg[0]) is where you want to get the file from, the second one (args[1]) can be the #currentdir# or the save location of your file . The third one (args[2]) is for if you are doing #currentdir#, if so, then the filename must be given, or this could be for -show which is a parameter that shows the user where the path is, with #currentdir# this is the fourth paramter which is args[3]");
